## What is Lusan?
An e-commerce style site to streamline buying seeds by signposting and comparing seed providers.

## What did we build?
We focused on building the front-end of the site as the data is being prepared. We used next.js so the next development team will be able to encorporate a back-end.

[Deployed version here!](https://lusan-tfb-ltfb.vercel.app/)
